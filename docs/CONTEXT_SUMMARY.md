# Data Tree - Context Summary Cards

## 2025-05-21: Phase 2 Completion

**Project Goal:**
Develop "Data Tree," a client-side web application for visualizing and interacting with hierarchical data structures (files and folders). The long-term vision includes evolving this into a "Data Forest" with backend persistence, API capabilities for LLM integration, and eventually a 3D navigable interface.

**Phase 1 Completion Summary:**
*   Implemented the core visual tree structure using static, hardcoded data.
*   Basic functionalities included expanding/collapsing folders.
*   Initial "biological tree" styling with connector lines and nature-themed icons was applied.
*   Files: `index.html`, `style.css`, `script.js`.

**Phase 2 Completion Summary (Enhanced Local Tree Functionality):**
Phase 2 focused on adding rich client-side interactions to the 2D tree. All planned core features for this phase are now implemented.

*   **Features Implemented in Phase 2:**
    *   **2.A: Add New Nodes:**
        *   Global button to add new root trees (folders).
        *   Contextual "[+]" icons on folders to add new child files or sub-folders.
        *   User prompts for node name and type (file/folder).
        *   Unique ID generation for all nodes.
    *   **2.B: Two-Stage File Content Viewer & Editor:**
        *   **Inline Preview:** Clicking a file name shows a content snippet and action icons (View Full üëÅÔ∏è, Copy üìã, Download üíæ, Edit ‚úèÔ∏è, Close Preview ‚ùå).
        *   **Dedicated Viewer Panel:** Clicking "View Full" icon opens a larger modal-like panel displaying full file content with its own Copy, Download, and Close controls.
        *   **Content Editing:** "Edit ‚úèÔ∏è" icon (on file nodes and in inline preview) opens an inline textarea for modifying mock file content; changes are saved to the client-side data model.
    *   **2.C: Drag-and-Drop Manipulation:**
        *   Nodes (files/folders) are draggable.
        *   Supports dropping items *into* other folders (move operation).
        *   Supports *reordering* items within the same parent list by dropping between items.
        *   Visual feedback (opacity, highlighting, drop indicator line) provided.
        *   Validation prevents dropping folders into their own descendants or items onto themselves.
    *   **2.D: Automatic Layout (Sorting):**
        *   A dropdown menu allows sorting the entire tree by "Name (A-Z)", "Name (Z-A)", or "Type (Folders First, then A-Z)".
        *   Sorting is recursive through all subfolders.
    *   **2.E: Refined "Add Node" UX:**
        *   The prompt for choosing between file/folder when adding a new node was changed from a `confirm()` dialog to a `prompt()` asking for text input ("file" or "folder").
    *   **2.F: Deleting Nodes:**
        *   "Delete üóëÔ∏è" icons added to all nodes.
        *   Confirmation prompts are shown before deletion.
        *   Deletes files or folders (including all children recursively).
        *   Tree UI updates immediately.

*   **Key Architectural Points for Phase 1 & 2:**
    *   Purely client-side application (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
    *   Data (`fileTreeData`) managed as a JavaScript array of nested objects in global scope, initialized and manipulated on the client. No backend persistence yet.
    *   Global state variables track UI states (e.g., `currentlyEditingNodeId`, `isDedicatedViewerOpen`).
    *   Most utility functions (ID generation, data manipulation, closing overlays, etc.) and rendering functions (`renderTree`, `renderTreeRecursive`) are in the global scope.
    *   Core event handlers for dynamic elements are defined within an `eventHandlers` object inside `DOMContentLoaded` and passed to global rendering functions (via `document.eventHandlers` as a temporary bridge for `deleteNodeById` to access `renderTree` with correct handlers).
    *   Debugging `console.log` statements are currently active in several functions.

*   **Known Issues (as of 2025-05-21):**
    *   **Drag-and-Drop:** Intermittent bug where a file can disappear after a D&D operation. Some D&D interactions might feel slightly "janky." (Tracked in `BUGS.md`).

**Current Status:**
*   Phase 2 (Enhanced Local Tree Functionality) is considered functionally complete.

**Next Major Goal:**
*   Begin planning for **Phase 3: API Integration & "Data Forest" Backend**, which will involve introducing server-side logic, a database for persistence, and an API.

## 2025-05-21: Phase 3 Planning & Initial Setup

**Objective:** Define core architecture for Phase 3 and prepare the development environment.

*   **Architectural Decisions for Phase 3 Backend:**
    *   **Overall Architecture:** Polyglot (Hybrid) approach.
    *   **Core Services (Networking, Concurrency, Mycelial Network Logic):** To be implemented in **Go**.
    *   **LLM/Agent API Layer (Tasking, Agent Management, UI-facing API):** To be implemented in **Python (FastAPI)**.
    *   **Database:** **Neo4j (Graph Database)** selected for its suitability in modeling complex relationships (Mycelial Network, agent connections, etc.).
    *   **Inter-Service Communication:** Planned to primarily use **gRPC**, potentially supplemented by Message Queues (e.g., NATS, RabbitMQ).

*   **Development Environment & Project Setup Progress (Completed):**
    *   **Version Control:** Project initialized as a Git repository and pushed to GitHub (`https://github.com/Septa-Serpenta-Seraph/Data-Forest`). All subsequent setup steps also committed.
    *   **Project Structure:** New directory structure implemented for `frontend`, `backend` (with `go_services` and `python_api` subdirs), `docs`, and `scripts`. Existing files moved. `.gitignore` and top-level `README.md` created and updated.
    *   **Docker Environment:** Docker Desktop successfully installed, configured (WSL 2, Execution Policy for PowerShell), and confirmed operational.
    *   **Neo4j Database:** Neo4j instance successfully running in a Docker container with persistent data volume. Accessible via Neo4j Browser.
    *   **Go "Hello World" Service:** Basic Go HTTP service (`core_service`) created, module initialized, and confirmed running.
    *   **Python/FastAPI "Hello World" Service:** Basic FastAPI HTTP service (`python_api`) created with virtual environment, dependencies installed, and confirmed running via Uvicorn.
    *   **Drag-and-Drop Debugging (Frontend):** Extensive logging added to `script.js`. Further direct investigation deferred.

*   **Next Immediate Steps for Phase 3 Implementation:**
    *   Define a simple service contract using Protocol Buffers (`.proto` file).
    *   Generate gRPC client/server code for both Go and Python services from the `.proto` file.
    *   Implement a basic gRPC client in the Go service to call the Python service.
    *   Implement a basic gRPC server in the Python service to handle the call from Go.
    *   Test inter-service communication.
