# Data-Forest

Welcome to the Data-Forest project!

This project aims to create a dynamic environment for visualizing, managing, and interacting with hierarchical data structures, evolving into a "Data Forest" with backend persistence, API capabilities for LLM integration, bot orchestration, and eventually a 3D navigable interface.

## Current Structure

-   `frontend/`: Contains the client-side Data Tree application (HTML, CSS, JavaScript).
-   `backend/`: Will house the backend services.
    -   `go_services/`: For core services written in Go.
    -   `python_api/`: For the Python/FastAPI service handling LLM/Agent interactions.
    -   `proto/`: For shared Protocol Buffer definitions (if using gRPC).
-   `docs/`: Contains project documentation like `BUGS.md` and `ROADMAP.md`.
-   `scripts/`: For utility and automation scripts.

## Getting Started
